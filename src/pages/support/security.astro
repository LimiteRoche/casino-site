      <p>
        At WinBet, we prioritize the security of our users' information,
        transactions, and gaming experience. Our systems and policies are
        designed to provide a secure environment, allowing you to focus on

        1. Data Encryption
      </h2>
      <p>
        We use industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption to protect
        data transmitted between your device and our servers. This encryption
        ensures that sensitive information, such as your personal details and
        payment data, remains secure and private.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[#ffd700]">
        2. Account Security
      </h2>
      <p>
        Your account's security is our priority. We recommend using a strong
        password, and we support two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra
        layer of protection. Additionally, we monitor account activity for
        suspicious behavior to help prevent unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[#ffd700]">
        3. Secure Payment Processing
      </h2>
      <p>
        All financial transactions on WinBet are processed through secure,
        PCI-compliant payment gateways. This ensures that your deposits and
        withdrawals are managed with the highest standards of security,
        minimizing the risk of data breaches and fraud.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[#ffd700]">
        4. Privacy and Data Protection
      </h2>
      <p>

        personal information. Our privacy policy outlines how we collect, use,
        and protect your data. We never share your information with third
        parties without your explicit consent, except as required by law.

        practices. While certain self-exclusion features may not be available in

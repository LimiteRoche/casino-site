      <p>
        At WinBet, we are committed to providing a safe and enjoyable gaming
        experience. We believe that gambling should always be a fun and engaging
        form of entertainment. However, we also recognize that gambling can lead
        to problems if not approached responsibly. Our goal is to ensure that
        our users enjoy their gaming experience in a safe and controlled
        environment.

        How to Play Responsibly
      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Set a budget before you start playing and stick to it.</li>
        <li>Never gamble more than you can afford to lose.</li>
        <li>Take regular breaks to avoid playing for too long.</li>
        <li>
          If you feel you are losing control, consider setting a deposit limit
          or using self-exclusion features.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#ffd700] mb-4">Self-Exclusion</h2>
      <p>
        If you ever feel that your gambling is getting out of control, we offer
        a self-exclusion feature. However, in the absence of direct control
        options in your profile, you can request self-exclusion through our <a
          href="/support/contact"
          class="text-yellow-500">contact form</a
        >. Our support team will help you with the process and ensure that your
        account is temporarily suspended.
